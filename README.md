## Odd or Even Exercise

### Instructions

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

`e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43`

- 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

`e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5`

- 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The `modulo` is written as a `percentage sign (%) in Python`. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

6 รท 2 = 3 with no remainder.

6 % 2 = 0
5 รท 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.

5 % 2 = 1
14 รท 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.

14 % 4 = 2
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

**Example Input 1**
43
**Example Output 1**
This is an odd number.
**Example Input 2**
94
**Example Output 2**
This is an even number.
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:



_Hint_
All even numbers can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
Try some using the modulo with some odd numbers e.g.

```3 % 2
5 % 2
7 % 2

Then try using the modulo with some even numbers e.g.

4 % 2
6 % 2
8 % 2
See what's in common each time.
```

## Nested if /else

```python
if condition:
    if another condition:
        do this
    else:
        do this
else:
    do this
```

**elif**

```python
if condition1:
    do A
elif condition2:
    do B
else:
    do this
```

### ๐ชThis is a Difficult Challenge ๐ช

**Instructions**
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

```e.g. The year 2000:

2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 รท 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 รท 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 รท 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
```
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input 1
2400
Example Output 1
Leap year.
Example Input 2
1989
Example Output 2
Not leap year.
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
